# Session Management

1. Improve the session management system by using the things like after the user clicks `download <summary-detailed> report button`, then send the request to the server that the current session's artifacts are needed to be deleted from there.

2. Have a mechanism to delete the session data everyday. (ex. cronjob, etc.)
